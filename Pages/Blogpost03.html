               Studying is hard, scrolling is easy. Here are some apps I use put the phone down, and keep it down! 
            </p>
<!-- paragraph on focus -->
            <h3 class="subheading">focus keeper</h3>
            <p class="textpost">
                <b>Focus Keeper</b> is an app that uses a Pomodoro timer to target your focus and to 
                ensure you are resting too! The defaults are set to focus for 25mins, rest for 5, then on 
                the 4th rest, it's a longer 20min one. Time flies when I'm using this app, I'm also 
                standing up more often and giving my eyes a break from my screen more often. And, I'm also 
                getting a lot of work done!

                So you have some goals, some targets, you want to spend x amount of hours on study and x amount on work 
                and x amount of homework and x amount on self learning? But how do track that? With <b>Toggl Track!</b> Easy to launch, 
                easy to use, and the reporting? Also great! Toggl works with a login, so you can access your stuff through 
                a browser too.

            <p class="textpost">Ok so this one is just a bit cute. It's also a way to "lock" you out of your phone. Because once 
                you've hit 'plant', if you try to do anything else with your phone, your little tree will die. Every tree ends 
                up in your little <b>Forest</b>. A productive day never looked so good!
